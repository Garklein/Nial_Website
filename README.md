# Nial Array Language

Nial is a general purpose programming language based on a formal model of Arrays developed by Trenchard More and Michael Jenkins. 

Nial is part of the APL family of programming languages but differs from standard APL in that it offers a more traditional programming language syntax.

Nested arrays of multiple dimensions are the primary data type of Nial. Arrays together with an extensible core set of functions to manipulate arrays and a programming language for construction of more complex computations allow for the development of efficient programs that can take advntage of the characteristics of modern CPUs.
