# About

Nial (Nested Interactive Array Language) is a general purpose programming language based on a formal model of Arrays developed by Trenchard More and Michael Jenkins.

Nial is part of the APL family of programming languages, with the philosophy that the best design could come from a combination of both functional and imperative styles in an array language. It differs from standard APL in that it offers a more traditional programming language syntax.

Nested arrays of multiple dimensions are the primary data type of Nial. Arrays together with an extensible core set of functions/operators to manipulate arrays and a programming language for the construction of more complex computations allow for the development of efficient programs that can take advantage of the characteristics of modern CPUs.
