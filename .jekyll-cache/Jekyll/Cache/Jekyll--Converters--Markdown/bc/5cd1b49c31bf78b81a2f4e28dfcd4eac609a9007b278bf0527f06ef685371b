I"à<p>Welcome to the Nial language website.</p>

<p>Nial (Nested Interactive Array Language) is a general purpose programming language based on a formal model of Arrays developed by Trenchard More and Michael Jenkins.</p>

<p>Nial is part of the APL family of programming languages but differs from standard APL in that it offers a more traditional programming language syntax.</p>

<p>Nested arrays of multiple dimensions are the primary data type of Nial. Arrays together with an extensible core set of functions/operators to manipulate arrays and a programming language for the construction of more complex computations allow for the development of efficient programs that can take advantage of the characteristics of modern CPUs.</p>
